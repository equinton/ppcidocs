These pages are stored in the writable/templates_c folder.\n\n\nBootstrap 3 was compiled using the colors of the former Irstea graphic charter. Additional CSS styles are available in the public/display/CSS/bootstrap-prototypephp.css file.\n\n\n\nImages are usually stored in the public/display/images folder.\nMost Javascript libraries are managed by npm, and are stored in public/display/node-modules. If additional scripts are needed (and not integrated into Smarty templates), you will find them in the public/display/javascript folder.\n\n\n\nThe display of HTML pages is entrusted to the SmartyPpci view, which can be instantiated as follows:\n$view = service (\"Smarty\");\nSee the views.html page for details on how it works.\n\n\n\nMost forms are constructed like this:\n&lt;form class=\"form-horizontal\" id=\"appliForm\" method=\"post\" action=\"appliChange\"&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"aclappli_id\" value=\"{$data.aclappli_id}\"&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"moduleBase\" value=\"appli\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"form-group\"&gt;\n        &lt;label for=\"appli\" class=\"control-label col-md-4\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"red\"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; \n                {t}Nom de l'application :{/t}\n        &lt;/label&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"col-md-8\"&gt;\n            &lt;input id=\"appli\" type=\"text\" name=\"appli\" class=\"form-control\" value=\"{$data.appli}\"\n                    autofocus required&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"form-group\"&gt;\n        &lt;label for=\"applidetail\" class=\"control-label col-md-4\"&gt;{t}Description :{/t} &lt;/label&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"col-md-8\"&gt;\n            &lt;input id=\"applidetail\" type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" name=\"applidetail\"\n                    value=\"{$data.applidetail}\"&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"form-group center\"&gt;\n        &lt;button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary button-valid\"&gt;{t}Valider{/t}&lt;/button&gt;\n        {if $data.aclappli_id &gt; 0 }\n        &lt;button class=\"btn btn-danger button-delete\"&gt;{t}Supprimer{/t}&lt;/button&gt;\n        {/if}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    {$csrf}\n&lt;/form&gt;\nIn the form tag, the action corresponds to the route to call. The moduleBase variable contains the route stem: pressing the delete button (button-delete class) will modify the route by replacing it with the content of moduleBase concatenated to Delete.\nMost of the classes are those provided by Bootstrap 3.\nThe {$csrf} variable contains the &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"csrf_app_name\" value=\"xxxxxx\"&gt; field generated by CodeIgniter and used to prevent cross script request forgery attacks.\n\n\n\nTables, in their vast majority, use the Datatables component for their display. Here is a typical example of a call:\n&lt;table id=\"appliListe\" class=\"table table-bordered table-hover datatable display\" data-order='[[ 0, \"asc\" ]]'&gt;\nThe datatable class is described in the main_js.tpl template. It contains the initialization of the Datatables component with translation management and pre-programming of the proposed functions. Several classes allow you to quickly manage the different activatable functionalities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass\nSearch\nPagination\nSort\nExport buttons\n\n\n\n\ndatatable\n\nX\nX\n\n\n\ndatatable-nopaging-nosearching\n\n\nX\n\n\n\ndatatable-searching\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n\ndatatable-nopaging\nX\n\nX\n\n\n\ndatatable-nopaging-nosort\nX\n\n\n\n\n\ndatatable-nosort\n\nX\n\n\n\n\ndatatable-export\nX\n\nX\nX\n\n\ndatatable-export-paging\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n\nTables use the moment component to handle dates.\n\n\n\n\nnumber: control of the entry of integers\nrate: control of the entry of decimal numbers (separator: point)\nuuid: verification of fields containing an identifier of type UUID\ndatepicker: selection of a date\ndatetimepicker: selection of a date/time\ntimepicker: selection of a time (hh:mm:ss)\ntextarea-edit: multiline text area (textarea) with tab management to obtain text indents\nconfirm: display of a confirmation box on click or keypress\n\nTwo more, two additional functions are available:\n\nencodeHtml(content): encodes a string in HTML. This is a function used to encode information retrieved by an Ajax request\noperationConfirm(): displays a dialog box to confirm the operation to be performed.\n\n\n\n\nLabel translations are provided by the smarty-gettext library. Labels to be translated must be included between the {t} and {/t} tags.\nFor more details on translation management, see this page.\n\n\n\n\nThe menu is built dynamically taking into account the user’s rights. It is described in the app/Config/menu.xml file, and is structured as follows:\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;menu xmlns:its=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/11/its\" its:version=\"2.0\"&gt;\n    &lt;its:rules version=\"2.0\"&gt;\n        &lt;its:translateRule selector=\"//item/@label\" translate=\"yes\" /&gt;\n        &lt;its:translateRule selector=\"//item/@tooltip\" translate=\"yes\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/its:rules&gt;\n\n    &lt;item module=\"manage\" label=\"Gestion\" tooltip=\"Gestion\"&gt;\n        &lt;item divider='1' droits=\"param\" /&gt;\n        &lt;item module=\"requestList\" label=\"Requêtes SQL\" tooltip=\"Exécution de requêtes SQL dans la base de données\" droits=\"param\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/item&gt;\n&lt;/menu&gt;\nThe translateRule commands are used to generate translations. Each menu entry can contain a submenu: in the example above, the first level (module=manage) contains two entries.\nFor each entry, it is possible to indicate:\n\nmodule: the name of the route (CodeIgniter name) that must be called\nlabel: the label that is displayed\ntooltip: the text that is displayed on hover\nrights: the rights that the user must have for the menu entry to be displayed\nonlynoconnect=“1”: the entry is only displayed if the user is not logged in (used to display the login button, in particular)\nloginrequis=“1”: the entry is only displayed if the user is logged in\nisdoc=“1”: the link will be generated using the root described in app.docroot concatenated with the content of the module attribute (automatic addition of /), and will trigger display in a new tab. This mechanism is used for external documentation.\n\nOnly the first three attributes are mandatory.\nIt is also possible to draw a dividing line by adding the attribute divider=“1” (with or without rights).\nThe menu is stored in a session variable in the form of a list (attributes &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;), and is generated each time the user’s state changes (connection, disconnection)."

It will also look for the MIME type if it is not provided.\nTo work, it is necessary to indicate specific parameters:\n$param = array(\n\"filename\" =&gt; \"\", /* name of the file as it will appear in the browser */\n\"disposition\" =&gt; \"attachment\", /* attachment: the file is downloaded, inline: the file is displayed */\n\"tmp_name\" =&gt; \"\", /* location of the file in the server */\n\"content_type\" =&gt; \"\", /* mime type */\n\"is_reference\" =&gt; false, /* if true, tmp_name contains the handle of the opened file */\n\"handle\" =&gt; 0);\nsetParam(?array $param);\n\n\nSending a file\n$view = service (\"FileView\");\nThe operation is quite similar to BinaryView, except that it only works from an existing file. The MIME type can also be searched automatically if it is not not specified.\n$param = array(\n\"filename\" =&gt; \"export.txt\", /* name of the file as it will appear in the browser */\n\"disposition\" =&gt; \"attachment\", /* attachment: the file is downloaded, inline: the file is displayed */\n\"content_type\" =&gt; \"\", /* mime type */\n\"tmp_name\" =&gt; \"\", /* Name of the file to send */\n);\n\n\nAjax Request\n$view = service (\"AjaxView\");\nView used to respond to an Ajax request. The content, which is provided by default in the form of a table (Json content possible by setting the variable is_json to true), is encoded in html then transformed into a JSON string before being sent to the browser.\n\n\nSending a CSV file\n$view = service (\"CsvView\");\nThis view will generate a CSV file from a table ($data[][]). The generation and sending of the file is done with the function:\nfunction send($filename = \"\", $delimiter = \"\")\nThe name of the file can be generated automatically. The delimiter can be a semicolon, a comma or a tab (indicate ). The first header line is generated from the keys of the first record in the table.\n\n\nSending a JSON file\n$view = service (\"JsonFileView\");\nThe view generates a file in the browser, with a functioning close to the Ajax view. If the data is provided to the class in the form of an array, it is encoded in html before transformation into Json.\n\n\nSending a PDF file\n$view = service (\"PdfView\");\nTransfers a PDF file, either directly to be displayed, or as an attached file. Same functioning as the FileView view.\n\n\nSending arbitrary content to the browser\n$view = service (\"DisplayView\");\nThis is a view that transmits any content to the browser, without encoding or MIME type."
